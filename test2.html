<h1 id="layers">Layers</h1>
<p>A layer acts like a transparent sheet upon which shapes can be placed, sub-layers (layers within layers to any desired depth are supported. Layers provide a mechanism for overlaying groups of views on top of each other. Layers can also clip their contents to exclude any content outside a user defined area.</p>
<p>Layers can be 2D or 3D, defined by their <em>behaviour</em> property.</p>

</div>
<p>When a layer is added to the stage it is assigned a unique depth value. By default the stage has a root layer with a depth value of 0.</p>
<p>Layers are Views and they inherit position, orientation and scale of their parent View. Layers are drawn in an order determined by a layer depth value.</p>
<p><strong>Note: Layers work independently of the View hierarchy.</strong> Layers can be positioned anywhere in the View tree. The layer draw order is always defined by the <em>depth</em> value.</p>

<h4 id="background">Background</h4>
<ul>
<li>Graphics are drawn in DALi using renderers</li>
<li>Views can have zero or many renderers</li>
<li>Renderers can be shared by Views</li>
<li>Renderers have a depth index property</li>
</ul>
<p>With LAYER_UI, the draw order of the renderers is defined by both:</p>
<ul>
<li>Renderer depth index.</li>
<li>Position of view in the view tree</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="layer_3d">Layer_3D</h3>
<p>Set Layer behaviour to &quot;LAYER_3D&quot;;</p>
<p>Opaque renderers are drawn first and writen to the depth buffer.</p>

<p>Transparent renderers are drawn in order of distance from the camera ( painter's algorithm ).</p>

<p>Inside a layer it is possible to force a tree views to be drawn on top of everything else in the layer.</p>
